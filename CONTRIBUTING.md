# Contributing

We need help!  The best way to do so is to create a pull request related to a particular feature or
bug.

## Submitting a PR

We prefer to use the forking workflow for PRs.  You will want to [fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and then create a PR that way.

For PRs that address github issues please use one of the following keywords followed by the issue `id` so that those can auto close when the PR has been merged.

- close
- closes
- closed
- fix
- fixes
- fixed
- resolve
- resolves
- resolved

example: `closes #123`

## What are the list of tasks that need doing?

TBD

## Who approves PRs?

Are you familiar with how new Popes are selected?  Well it's kind of like that.  Once all the back-and-forth is done, you'll see white smoke emerge from some sancitifed chimney and you will know you have contributed to ChiCommons.


**No matter your role, your help is very much appreciated!**
